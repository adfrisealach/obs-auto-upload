# OBS Auto-Upload to Backblaze B2

Automatically upload your OBS screen recordings to Backblaze B2 cloud storage with intelligent file monitoring, stability detection, and safe deletion.

## Features

- üéØ **Smart File Detection**: Monitors OBS recordings and waits for them to finish before uploading
- üîÑ **Automatic Upload**: Uses rclone with optimized settings for fast, reliable uploads
- üóëÔ∏è **Safe Deletion**: Verifies uploads before deleting local files
- üì± **Notifications**: macOS notifications and optional NTFY push notifications
- üîß **Configurable**: Easy-to-use `.env` configuration file
- üöÄ **Auto-Start**: Runs automatically on login using macOS launchd
- üìä **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for monitoring and troubleshooting

## How It Works

1. **File Monitoring**: Uses `fswatch` to detect new `.mkv` files in your OBS directory
2. **Stability Detection**: Waits for files to stop growing (configurable timeout)
3. **Upload**: Uses `rclone` with optimized settings for Backblaze B2
4. **Verification**: Confirms file exists remotely with correct size
5. **Cleanup**: Safely deletes local file after successful upload

## Requirements

- macOS (tested on macOS 14+)
- Homebrew package manager
- Backblaze B2 account
- OBS Studio (or any software that creates `.mkv` files)

## Quick Start

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Run the setup script**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```
3. **Follow the prompts** to configure rclone and set up the service
4. **Start recording** with OBS - files will be uploaded automatically!

## Installation

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

The setup script will handle everything for you:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This will:
- Install dependencies (`rclone`, `fswatch`)
- Configure rclone for Backblaze B2
- Create configuration files
- Set up auto-start service
- Test the configuration

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   brew install rclone fswatch
   ```

2. **Configure rclone**:
   ```bash
   rclone config
   # Choose "n" for new remote
   # Name: b2-remote
   # Type: Backblaze B2
   # Enter your Application Key ID and Key
   ```

3. **Create configuration**:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your settings
   ```

4. **Make script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x obs-auto-upload.sh
   ```

## Configuration

Edit the `.env` file to customize your settings:

### Required Settings

```bash
# Your rclone remote name
REMOTE_NAME="b2-remote"

# Your Backblaze B2 bucket name
BUCKET_NAME="your-bucket-name"

# Directory to monitor for OBS recordings
WATCH_DIR="/Users/yourusername/Movies/OBS"

# Folder in bucket where files will be stored
REMOTE_BASE_PATH="obs-recordings/"
```

### Optional Settings

```bash
# File extensions to monitor
EXTENSIONS="mkv mp4 mov avi"

# Stability timeout (seconds to wait after file stops growing)
STABILITY_TIMEOUT=45

# Upload optimization
UPLOAD_TRANSFERS=6
CHUNK_SIZE="50M"
BANDWIDTH_LIMIT="18M"

# Safety settings
DELETE_AFTER_UPLOAD=true
VERIFY_UPLOAD=true

# Notifications
ENABLE_NOTIFICATIONS=true
NTFY_TOPIC="https://ntfy.sh/your-topic"  # Optional
```

## Usage

### Running Manually

```bash
# Start the monitoring service
./obs-auto-upload.sh

# View logs in real-time
tail -f ~/logs/obs-backup.log
```

### Auto-Start Service

The setup script can configure the service to start automatically:

```bash
# Start the service
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.obs-auto-upload.plist

# Stop the service
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.obs-auto-upload.plist

# Check service status
launchctl list | grep obs-auto-upload
```

### Monitoring

```bash
# View application logs
tail -f ~/logs/obs-backup.log

# View service logs
tail -f ~/logs/obs-auto-upload.out
tail -f ~/logs/obs-auto-upload.err
```

## File Processing Flow

```
OBS Recording Created
       ‚Üì
File Detected by fswatch
       ‚Üì
Added to Monitoring Queue
       ‚Üì
Wait for File Stability (45s default)
       ‚Üì
Upload to Backblaze B2
       ‚Üì
Verify Upload Success
       ‚Üì
Delete Local File
       ‚Üì
Send Notification
```

## Notifications

### macOS Notifications

Automatically shows notifications for:
- New recording detected
- Upload started
- Upload completed
- Upload failed

### NTFY Push Notifications

Set `NTFY_TOPIC` in `.env` to receive push notifications on any device:

```bash
NTFY_TOPIC="https://ntfy.sh/your-unique-topic"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Script won't start**:
- Check if `.env` file exists and is configured
- Verify rclone remote is set up: `rclone listremotes`
- Test bucket access: `rclone lsd b2-remote:your-bucket-name`

**Files not uploading**:
- Check file extensions in `EXTENSIONS` setting
- Verify file size meets `MIN_FILE_SIZE_MB` requirement
- Check logs for stability timeout issues

**Upload failures**:
- Verify internet connection
- Check Backblaze B2 credentials
- Review bandwidth limits in configuration

**Service not starting automatically**:
- Check launch agent: `launchctl list | grep obs-auto-upload`
- Verify plist file exists: `ls ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.obs-auto-upload.plist`
- Check service logs: `tail -f ~/logs/obs-auto-upload.err`

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```bash
# In .env file
LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"
```

### Manual Testing

Test individual components:

```bash
# Test rclone connection
rclone lsd b2-remote:your-bucket-name

# Test file upload
rclone copy test-file.mkv b2-remote:your-bucket-name/obs-recordings/

# Test fswatch
fswatch -1 ~/Movies/OBS
```

## File Structure

```
obs-auto-upload/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ obs-auto-upload.sh    # Main script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.sh             # Automated setup script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ env.example          # Configuration template
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                 # Your configuration (created by setup)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Upload Settings

For different internet speeds, adjust these settings in `.env`:

```bash
# For slower connections
UPLOAD_TRANSFERS=2
BANDWIDTH_LIMIT="5M"

# For faster connections
UPLOAD_TRANSFERS=10
BANDWIDTH_LIMIT="50M"
```

### Multiple File Types

Monitor additional file types:

```bash
EXTENSIONS="mkv mp4 mov avi flv"
```

### Custom Stability Timeout

For longer recordings or slower storage:

```bash
STABILITY_TIMEOUT=120    # 2 minutes
MAX_WAIT_TIME=14400     # 4 hours
```

## Security Considerations

- rclone stores credentials securely in `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`
- `.env` file contains no sensitive information
- All uploads use HTTPS encryption
- File verification prevents incomplete uploads
